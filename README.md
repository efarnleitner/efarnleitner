- Hello everyone! I'm Elias, a 26-year-old economist currently living in Vienna. 
- My passion is exploring the intersection of development economics, spatial econometrics and climate change.
- In particular, my research is concerned with studying the relationship between climate-related shocks and their impact on economic development.
