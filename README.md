- Welcome and Servus! I'm Elias, a 27-year-old economist currently based in Vienna. In September 2023, I graduated from the Paris School of Economics.
- My research interests lie at the intersection of development economics, spatial econometrics and climate change.
- Besides doing econ stuff, I am also the winner of the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize, the former youngest person in the world and a sports addict. Siuuu!
